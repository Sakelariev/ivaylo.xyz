Huberman makes a huge mistake saying that “if you have a 20% chance of pregnancy in any given month, the chance of being pregnant after 6 months is 120%”. Let's make the actual calculations to learn from his mistake.
```{r}
# Likelihood of not getting pregnant after 6 months of trying with 20% probability each month
prob_not = dbinom(0, size=6, prob = 0.2)
print(paste("Likelihood of not getting pregnant:", prob_not))

# Likelihood of getting pregnant
prob_pregnant = 1 - dbinom(0, size=6, prob = 0.2)
print(paste("Likelihood of getting pregnant: ", prob_pregnant))
```
Now let's see the analytical solution as well.
```{r}
 1-(0.8^6)
```
